# Setup Summary - Find Your Word Widget

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
You had a working setup in `/old/fyw2` where:
- Shopify loaded the widget
- Widget made requests to Digital Ocean server
- Server proxied to OpenAI (keeping API key secure)

The new build wasn't set up this way - it was trying to call OpenAI directly from the client.

### Solution
Updated the architecture to match your working old setup:

```
Shopify → Widget → YOUR Server → OpenAI
```

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Updated `server.js`
- ✅ Added `dotenv` support for environment variables
- ✅ Added POST endpoint: `/api/suggest-words`
- ✅ Server now proxies OpenAI requests
- ✅ Added proper CORS headers for Shopify
- ✅ API key stays on server (never exposed to client)

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- ✅ Added `dotenv` dependency

### 3. Updated `src/core/services/openai.service.ts`
- ✅ Changed to call YOUR server instead of OpenAI directly
- ✅ Removed API key from client-side code
- ✅ Uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable

### 4. Created Documentation
- ✅ `env.example` - Environment variable template
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment instructions
- ✅ `QUICK-DEPLOY.md` - 15-minute quick start guide

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Development Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Widget: Click "Find Your Word"
    Widget->>User: Show form
    User->>Widget: Submit answers
    Widget->>LocalServer: POST /api/suggest-words
    LocalServer->>OpenAI: POST with API key
    OpenAI->>LocalServer: Return suggestions
    LocalServer->>Widget: Return suggestions
    Widget->>User: Display results
```

### Production Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    ShopifyCustomer->>Widget: Click button
    Widget->>DOServer: POST /api/suggest-words
    DOServer->>OpenAI: POST with API key (secure)
    OpenAI->>DOServer: Return suggestions
    DOServer->>Widget: Return suggestions
    Widget->>ShopifyCustomer: Display results
```

## 📋 Next Steps For You

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your actual values:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (from OpenAI dashboard)
# - OPENAI_PROMPT_ID (your stored prompt ID)
# - VITE_API_BASE_URL (http://localhost:8080 for local testing)
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs the new `dotenv` package needed by server.js.

### 3. Test Locally

**Terminal 1 - Start Server:**
```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Find Your Word Widget v2 server running on port 8080
📦 Widget JS available at: /widget/v2/find-your-word-v2.iife.js
```

**Terminal 2 - Test Widget:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and test the full flow.

### 4. Deploy to Digital Ocean

Follow `QUICK-DEPLOY.md` for step-by-step instructions (takes ~15 min).

### 5. Add to Shopify

Once deployed, add these two lines to your Shopify theme:

```liquid
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app/widget/v2/style.css">
<script src="https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app/widget/v2/find-your-word-v2.iife.js" defer></script>
```

## 🔒 Security Benefits

### Old Way (If API key was in client)
- ❌ API key visible in widget JavaScript
- ❌ Anyone can extract and use your key
- ❌ No rate limiting control
- ❌ Hard to monitor usage

### New Way (API key on server)
- ✅ API key only on Digital Ocean server
- ✅ Never exposed to client
- ✅ Server can add rate limiting
- ✅ Easy to monitor and log requests
- ✅ Can add authentication if needed

## 🆘 If You Have Issues

### Issue: "OPENAI_API_KEY not configured"

**Solution:** 
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...` is set
3. Restart server (`npm start`)

### Issue: Widget loads but API fails

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` matches your server URL
3. Rebuild widget: `npm run build`
4. Redeploy to Digital Ocean

### Issue: CORS errors

**Solution:** Already handled! Server includes proper CORS headers. If you still see errors:
1. Check server logs in Digital Ocean
2. Verify widget is loaded from correct URL
3. Check Network tab in browser DevTools
