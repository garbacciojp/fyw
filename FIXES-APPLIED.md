# 🔧 Deployment Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**

---

## 🐛 Problems Identified

### Critical Issues:
1. **❌ Widget was looking for OpenAI credentials client-side**
   - `environment.config.ts` was checking for `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `VITE_OPENAI_PROMPT_ID`
   - These should ONLY exist on the server, not in the widget bundle
   - This was causing builds to fail or display errors about missing credentials

2. **❌ Type definitions included obsolete environment variables**
   - `vite-env.d.ts` defined `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `VITE_OPENAI_PROMPT_ID`
   - These variables should not be accessible to the client-side widget

3. **❌ Environment validation was checking wrong variables**
   - The widget was validating OpenAI credentials that shouldn't exist client-side
   - This caused confusion about what environment variables are actually needed

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `src/config/environment.config.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
export const env = {
  openai: {
    apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY || '',
    promptId: import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_PROMPT_ID || '',
  },
  debug: import.meta.env.VITE_DEBUG_MODE === 'true' || import.meta.env.DEV,
  // ...
}

export const validateEnvironment = () => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  if (!env.openai.apiKey) {
    errors.push('VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY is not configured');
  }
  if (!env.openai.promptId) {
    errors.push('VITE_OPENAI_PROMPT_ID is not configured');
  }
  return { valid: errors.length === 0, errors };
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const env = {
  apiBaseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080',
  debug: import.meta.env.VITE_DEBUG_MODE === 'true' || import.meta.env.DEV,
  // ...
}

export const validateEnvironment = () => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  if (!env.apiBaseUrl) {
    errors.push('VITE_API_BASE_URL is not configured');
  }
  if (env.apiBaseUrl && !env.apiBaseUrl.startsWith('http')) {
    errors.push('VITE_API_BASE_URL must start with http:// or https://');
  }
  return { valid: errors.length === 0, errors };
};
```

**Why:** The widget should only know about the API base URL, not OpenAI credentials.

---

### 2. Updated `src/vite-env.d.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY: string;
  readonly VITE_OPENAI_PROMPT_ID: string;
  readonly VITE_DEBUG_MODE: string;
  readonly DEV: boolean;
  readonly PROD: boolean;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  // API Base URL - our backend server that proxies to OpenAI
  // ⚠️ OpenAI credentials are NOT in the widget - they're on the server only!
  readonly VITE_API_BASE_URL: string;
  readonly VITE_DEBUG_MODE: string;
  readonly DEV: boolean;
  readonly PROD: boolean;
}
```

**Why:** Removed obsolete OpenAI credential type definitions. TypeScript now correctly reflects that these don't exist in the widget.

---

### 3. Verified `.env` Configuration

Your `.env` file is correctly configured with:
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY` - for server-side use
- ✅ `OPENAI_PROMPT_ID` - for server-side use
- ✅ `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://fyw-lrqe8.ondigitalocean.app` - for widget build
- ✅ `PORT=8080` - for local server

---

### 4. Verified Digital Ocean Deployment

All services are operational:
- ✅ Server running: https://fyw-lrqe8.ondigitalocean.app
- ✅ Health check passing: `/health` returns 200
- ✅ Widget files accessible: `/widget/v2/find-your-word-v2.iife.js` (328 KB)
- ✅ Widget styles accessible: `/widget/v2/style.css` (27 KB)
- ✅ API endpoint working: `/api/suggest-words` returns OpenAI responses
- ✅ CORS headers configured: `access-control-allow-origin: *`

---

## 🎯 Architecture (Corrected)

### Before (WRONG):
```
Shopify → Widget (needs OpenAI credentials) → OpenAI
         ❌ API key exposed to client
```

### After (CORRECT):
```
Shopify → Widget → Your Server → OpenAI
                    ✅ API key stays secure on server
```

**The widget NO LONGER needs OpenAI credentials.**  
It only needs to know the URL of your server (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`).

---

## 📋 Environment Variables

### Client-Side (Widget) - Set at Build Time:
These are baked into the widget bundle during `npm run build`:

| Variable | Purpose | Value |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Backend server URL | `https://fyw-lrqe8.ondigitalocean.app` |
| `VITE_DEBUG_MODE` | Debug logging | `false` (production) |

### Server-Side (Digital Ocean) - Set in DO Dashboard:
These stay on the server and are NEVER sent to the client:

| Variable | Purpose | Where to Set |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI authentication | DO Environment Variables |
| `OPENAI_PROMPT_ID` | OpenAI stored prompt | DO Environment Variables |
| `PORT` | Server port | Auto-set by DO (8080) |

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Test File Created: `SHOPIFY-TEST.html`

Open this file in your browser to:
1. ✅ Verify widget loads from Digital Ocean
2. ✅ Test all API endpoints
3. ✅ Check CORS headers
4. ✅ Validate full user flow
5. ✅ Get Shopify integration code

**To run:**
```bash
open SHOPIFY-TEST.html
```

This page simulates exactly how the widget will work on Shopify.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (Final)

### Step 1: Verify Build (Already Done)
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Build successful: 328 KB bundle
```

### Step 2: Verify Digital Ocean (Already Done)
```bash
curl https://fyw-lrqe8.ondigitalocean.app/health
# ✅ Returns: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

### Step 3: Test Locally
```bash
open SHOPIFY-TEST.html
# ✅ Run all automated tests
# ✅ Test widget manually
```

### Step 4: Add to Shopify

1. Go to: **Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes → Edit Code**
2. Open: `theme.liquid`
3. Add before `</body>`:

```liquid
<!-- Find Your Word Widget -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fyw-lrqe8.ondigitalocean.app/widget/v2/style.css">
<script src="https://fyw-lrqe8.ondigitalocean.app/widget/v2/find-your-word-v2.iife.js" defer></script>

<!-- Trigger Button -->
<button 
  onclick="window.FindYourWordWidget?.open()" 
  style="position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px; z-index: 9999; 
         padding: 16px 32px; background: #000; color: #fff; border: none; 
         border-radius: 8px; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;"
>
  Find Your Word
</button>
```

4. Click **Save**
5. Visit your store and test!

## 🎉 Summary

### What Was Wrong:
The widget was trying to access OpenAI credentials directly, which should only exist on the server. This caused build issues and confusion about required environment variables.

### What Was Fixed:
1. Removed OpenAI credential references from client-side code
2. Updated environment configuration to only check for API base URL
3. Fixed TypeScript definitions to match new architecture
4. Verified Digital Ocean deployment is working
5. Created comprehensive test and deployment documentation

### Result:
**Everything is now working correctly!** The widget:
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Loads from Digital Ocean
- ✅ Calls your server API (not OpenAI directly)
- ✅ Keeps API keys secure on server
- ✅ Ready for Shopify integration
