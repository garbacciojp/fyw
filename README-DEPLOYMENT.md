# 🚀 Ready for Deployment!

## What's Been Fixed

Your app now uses the **same architecture as your old working version**:

```
Shopify Store
    ↓ (loads widget)
Widget JavaScript
    ↓ (POST to your server)
Your Digital Ocean Server
    ↓ (proxies to OpenAI)
OpenAI API
    ↓ (returns suggestions)
Back to customer
```

✅ **API key stays secure on YOUR server** (not in the widget)  
✅ **Widget makes requests to YOUR backend** (not directly to OpenAI)  
✅ **Same setup as `/old/fyw2` that worked**

## 📋 Quick Start (Pick Your Path)

### Path 1: I Want to Deploy NOW (15 minutes)
👉 Read **`QUICK-DEPLOY.md`**

### Path 2: I Want Full Details
👉 Read **`DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`**

### Path 3: I Just Want to Test Locally First
👉 Follow below ⬇️

---

## 🧪 Test Locally First (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Set Up Environment

```bash
# Copy example file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your actual OpenAI credentials:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
# OPENAI_PROMPT_ID=pmpt_...
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 2: Install & Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Start Server

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Find Your Word Widget v2 server running on port 8080
```

### Step 4: Test

**In another terminal:**
```bash
# Test health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Test the full deployment
./test-deployment.sh http://localhost:8080
```

**Or test the widget UI:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173

## 🌐 Deploy to Digital Ocean

Once local testing works, follow **`QUICK-DEPLOY.md`** to deploy to Digital Ocean.

The key steps:
1. Push code to Git
2. Create Digital Ocean App
3. Set environment variables in DO dashboard
4. Deploy (takes 2-3 minutes)
5. Test deployment with: `./test-deployment.sh https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app`

---

## 🛍️ Add to Shopify

Once deployed to Digital Ocean, add to your Shopify theme:

```liquid
<!-- In theme.liquid, before </body> -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app/widget/v2/style.css">
<script src="https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app/widget/v2/find-your-word-v2.iife.js" defer></script>

<button onclick="window.FindYourWordWidget?.open()" 
        style="position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px; z-index: 9999; 
               padding: 16px 32px; background: #000; color: #fff; border: none; 
               border-radius: 8px; cursor: pointer; font-weight: 600;">
  Find Your Word
</button>
```

---

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

Use the provided test script:

```bash
# Test local
./test-deployment.sh http://localhost:8080

# Test production
./test-deployment.sh https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app
```

The script tests:
- ✅ Health endpoint
- ✅ Widget info
- ✅ Widget JavaScript file
- ✅ Widget CSS file
- ✅ API endpoint (OpenAI proxy)

## 📁 Important Files

| File | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `server.js` | Node.js server that serves widget and proxies API calls |
| `env.example` | Template for environment variables |
| `test-deployment.sh` | Automated testing script |

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "OPENAI_API_KEY not configured"

**Check:**
- `.env` file exists
- Contains `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...`
- Server restarted after creating `.env`

### Widget loads but API fails

**Check:**
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` matches server URL
- Rebuild widget: `npm run build`
- Check browser console for errors

### CORS errors

**Already fixed!** Server includes proper CORS headers.

---

## 🎯 Architecture Changes Made

### Before (❌ Insecure)
```
Widget → OpenAI (with API key in bundle)
```

### After (✅ Secure - Same as old working version)
```
Widget → YOUR Server → OpenAI (API key only on server)
```

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Test locally:** Follow "Test Locally First" above
2. **Deploy:** Read `QUICK-DEPLOY.md`
3. **Integrate:** Add to Shopify

**Estimated Total Time:** 20-30 minutes from here to live on Shopify

---

## 💡 What You Get

- ✅ Secure API key management (server-side only)
- ✅ Easy monitoring via Digital Ocean logs
- ✅ Can add rate limiting, caching, etc.
- ✅ Same architecture as your working old version
- ✅ Professional deployment setup
- ✅ Automated testing script
